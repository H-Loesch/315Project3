In the code turned in: line 369 of Test1.java needs to be uncommented in order for the remote client/server to work properly.

The main method is in Test1.java

Using the program:
Upon program start, it will bring up a window asking if you wish to play a local game, connect to another player as a server, or connect to another player as a client.  The required information (#pits, #pieces in each pits, time limit, port, hostname, etc) will be requested, and upon entering the game will begin. 
If the current player is a human, then moves must be chosen via clicking on the pits; the display will not update after this, and must be manually updated by clicking on one of the kalahs.
