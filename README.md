In the code turned in: line 369 of Test1.java needs to be uncommented in order for the remote client/server to work properly.

The main method is in Test1.java

Using the program:
Upon program start, it will bring up a window asking if you wish to play a local game, connect to another player as a server, or connect to another player as a client.  The required information (#pits, #pieces in each pits, time limit, port, hostname, etc) will be requested, and upon entering the game will begin. 
If the current player is a human, then moves must be chosen via clicking on the pits; the display will not update after this, and must be manually updated by clicking on one of the kalahs.

This repository has been ported from the TAMU Enterprise Github, to maintain my access to it upon graduation.
